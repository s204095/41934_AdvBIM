# A5: Reflect

## Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.

The course has been open-ended from the beginning, pushing me to take a position, make assumptions, and commit to developing a tool or solving a problem that might or might not prove fully relevant. It has also challenged me to think beyond the technical side and step into the role of a manager — balancing not just code and logic but also communication, coordination, and how a tool is perceived and used by others.

- Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:

I started with only basic Python experience, and most of my progress in reading and writing scripts has been strongly supported by AI — a level I wouldn’t have reached on my own. Through the process, I’ve gained a much clearer sense of how these technologies apply in practice and how both IfcOpenShell and Python can be used professionally and personally. At the same time, working from a managerial perspective helped me understand the importance of clarity, usability, and the social dynamics of presenting tools to a team.

- What else do you still need to learn?

I need to explore the IFC schema and buildingSMART standards more deeply to strengthen my understanding of the underlying data structures. This will enable me to build more relevant and robust tools in a professional environment.

- How you might use OpenBIM in the future:


I intend to continue developing my current tool, refining it, integrating additional features, and shaping it into a platform that supports technical work while also being accessible and valuable from a managerial viewpoint.


## Your process of developing the tutorial

- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?  

    Yes, I am thinking in writing by Bachlores thesis in this direction. 


- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
    
    Yes, I would prefere the begining to be more limited and clearer purpose on the expectations. However, it is a fine line between the amount of choices. 
    
- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
    
    It took abit time in integrating the tools and coordinating with other analyst groups, which eneded only with good collaboration with one of the analyst groups. 


## (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial

The feedback highlights that the tool delivers a very clear tutorial, an intuitive Streamlit interface, and strong visual outputs. Reviewers consistently found the walkthrough easy to follow and viewed the platform as an effective way to present multiple tools in one place. The UI and charts were praised for creating a fast, visual overview, and the option to use both default and custom price data was seen as valuable. Suggestions were minor, such as adding longer subtitles and showing percentages directly on pie charts. Overall, the tool is recognized as a solid, professional template for managers to showcase and manage group tools.

## (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?

Yes I would very like to do that in the future. 

- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

Yes and I expect a bigger expansion in the opensource area for the field to, atleast I would actively working towards that goal.

## (Individual) Wrap up
- conclude the journey through A1-A5

S204095

    The journey from A1 to A5 has been demanding, especially in the role of manager. Aligning each group’s output with an overall goal — one that wasn’t clearly defined in the beginning — proved difficult, and this was made even harder by the fact that many of us were still trying to understand the subject matter as we went along. I also struggled with shifting between being an analyst and being a manager. It was difficult to stay in the managerial role without slipping into the technical side, and at times I wasn’t sure how to contribute value purely as a manager.

    I didn’t fully live up to my own expectations in guiding the team, but I still managed to bring the process to a meaningful outcome. More importantly, the experience highlighted areas where I need to grow. The biggest one is communication across groups — understanding, coordinating, and aligning different directions and expectations. This turned out to be a much larger challenge than I anticipated, and it’s something I genuinely need to develop further for future projects.

    However I came through with what I think being a somewhat of an product that proves the concept, But with a few take aways on how and what I should be focusing on improving in the future. One of the most important point is "Communication with different groups" 

S215280

    When I started this course, my knowledge about OpenBIM and IFC was very limited. I had no experience at all with automated data extraction, using Python for BIM tasks, or working with IfcOpenShell. I also didn’t know much about digital workflows. 
    As the course progressed, I learned much more than I expected. One of the biggest things I learned was how to use IfcOpenShell. I learned how to open IFC models in Python, how to find and read information from IfcSpace, and how to work with Psets and BaseQuantities. 
    I also learned how to develop an OpenBIM-based tools. This included classifying spaces with keyword matching, connecting IFC data with cost data, and showing the results in Streamlit. 
    During the course, I was also introduced to GitHub. Before this, I had almost no knowledge of version control. I learned how to create and clone repositories, make commits, and work together in a structured way. Even though I did not use all the advanced features of GitHub, I now understand the basics and feel more comfortable working with shared code.
    I would like to learn more about advanced IFC geometry, 4D/5D BIM and to become better at coding in Python. 
    I can definitely see myself using OpenBIM in the future. The skills I learned here can be useful for early cost simulations, facility management tasks, and for checking the quality of models. The course also helped me to understand how to ask better questions when working with BIM, which will be useful when I later work on my thesis. Because of this, I think/hope that OpenBIM will be part of my future thesis.
    While developing our tool, I sometimes felt that a bit more structure and clearer guidelines at the start could have helped. There were times when we (as a manager group) were a bit confused about our delivery/tasks.  But overall, the tools we used were relevant.
    I also believe that OpenBIM will be important in my future professional life. The building industry is moving toward more automation, more data, and more use of open formats. So I think the things I learned in this course will continue to be valuable.
    I think the course was very interesting, but sometimes also a bit confusing, especially when it came to understanding exactly what we were supposed to deliver as a manager group. The examples from previous years were extremely helpful, and honestly, I don’t think we would have managed without them.
    If I had to take the course again, I would probably choose to be in an analyst group instead of a manager group. But at the same time, I still feel that I grew personally by being a manager. I learned how to communicate better with other groups and how to create collaboration between people, which was a valuable experience for me.
