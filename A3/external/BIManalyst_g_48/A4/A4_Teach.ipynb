    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "For the tool to function correctly, the IFC model must include the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spaces**\n",
    "  - Must be of type *IfcSpace*.\n",
    "  - Must contain *NetFloorArea* in the quantity set *Qto_SpaceBaseQuantities*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Walls**\n",
    "  - Must be of type *IfcWall* or *IfcCurtainWall*.\n",
    "  - The *Name* or *ObjectType* must include either *interior* or *exterior*.\n",
    "  - Must contain *Length*, *NetSideArea*, and *NetVolume* in the quantity set *Qto_WallBaseQuantities*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Columns**\n",
    "  - Must be of type *IfcColumn*\n",
    "  - Must contain *Depth* and *Width* in the property set *Dimensions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use the Tool\n",
    "1. Load your IFC model.  \n",

    "## Quick introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are group 48 in BUILD, and the tool we have developed is a relatively simple tool, made to quickly list all areas in an architectural model.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the input of an IFC model with IfcSpace, IfcWall, IfcCurtainWall and IfcColumn defined, our tool outputs an overview of all areas, as well as the areas occupied by walls, curtainwalls and columns in the shape of a .json file.\n",

    "- how it works \n",

    "### Finding the concept\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early stages of development, the initial idea was to compare a given IFC model against a list of client requirements, where given a list of requirements and a model, the tool would indicate compliance. This was specifically targeted at the building requirements given in the Advanced Building Design course.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](../A2/IMG/A2D.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after coordination with the rest of the team, it was evident that this was too complex and that more value could be produced from simply listing the distribution of areas in a model for the following reasons:\n",
    "- The tool would become much easier to use by not having to understand a set logic for comparison, while almost providing the same level of information.\n",
    "- A simple overview of the different areas are useful to a larger part of the group (e.g. useful to MEP for planning heating, cooling, ventilation etc.)\n",
    "- The code behind the tool also becomes both simpler and easier to understand."

    "In the scripting process we encountered two main challenges.\n",

    "#### Relying solely on quantity sets\n",
    "For simplicity we aimed to create functions only depend on quantity sets. Ensuring this prooved to be difficult, as not every element in an IFC file may have these sets defined or populated correctly. Inconsistencies or gaps in how quantity sets are assigned across different models and authoring tools require manual preprocessing or additional logic to attain reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Folder handling and CSV file management\n",
    "Locating and copying the correct CSV file from directory structures presents compatability concerns, especially when scripts are moved between different computers or environments. Funcitons hardcoded to specific folder paths or file names lose portability, so scripts must include dynamic directory handling and robust error checking to remain usable for various users and projects."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "095eefd5",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Possible improvements\n",
    "#### CSV-files\n",
    "Currently, the code requires a CSV file with a specific column header to calculate the aggregated price per $m^2$. To improve flexibility, the function could be modified to handle CSV files with different structures or column names, ensuring that the script does not depend on a single predefined format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing data\n",
    "We aimed to design a script that relies on as few variables as possible. To achieve this, most functions were built to depend only on quantity sets, with the exception of columns, which did not include any. A potential improvement would be to begin the script by processing the IFC file to ensure that all relevant elements contain the necessary quantity sets before the main calculations run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Failsafes\n",
    "To make the script more robust and compatible with different IFC files, additional failsafes should be implemented. These checks ensure that the script can handle missing elements, undefined values, or unexpected data structures without causing errors or interruptions during execution"
